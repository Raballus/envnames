Description: A set of functions to keep track of user-defined
    environment names which cannot be retrieved with the built-in function `environmentName`.
    The main function for this purpose is `environment_name` which returns the name of the given
    environment.
    The package also provides additional functionality, the most important of which are:  
    - A function (`obj_find`) to search for objects that extends the functionality of `exists`
    as follows: objects are searched recursively within all user-defined environments as well.  
    - An easy way to get the stack of calling functions (using `get_fun_calling_chain`), or just
    the calling function with its enclosing environment (using `get_fun_calling`), compared to the
    built-in function `sys.call`.  
    - A function (`get_obj_address`) to retrieve the memory address of an object.
