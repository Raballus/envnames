Description: A set of functions to keep track of user-defined
    environment names which cannot be retrieved with the base function \code{environmentName()}.
    The main function for this purpose is \code{environment_name()} which returns the name of the given
    environment.
    The package also provides additional functionality such as:
    \itemize{
    \item A function (\code{obj_find()}) to search for objects which extends the functionality of \code{exists()}
    and \code{find()} in that objects are searched also within all user-defined environments.
    \item An easy way (using \code{get_fun_calling_chain()}) to get the stack of calling functions, compared to the
    currently existing function \code(sys.call()).
    \item A function (\code{get_obj_address()}) to return the memory address of an object.
    \item A function (\code{get_env_names()}) that creates a map of environment names and their memory addresses
    (used internally by \code{environment_name()} to return the names of user-defined environments).
    }
