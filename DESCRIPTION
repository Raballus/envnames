Description: A set of functions to keep track of user-defined
    environment names which cannot be retrieved with the built-in function `environmentName`.
    The main function for this purpose is `environment_name` which returns the name of the given
    environment.
    The package also provides additional functionality such as:  
    - A function (`obj_find`) to search for objects which extends the functionality of `exists`
    and `find` in that objects are searched also within all user-defined environments.  
    - An easy way (using `get_fun_calling_chain` to get the stack of calling functions, compared to the
    built-in function `sys.call`.  
    - A function (`get_obj_address`) to return the memory address of an object.  
    - A function (`get_env_names`) that creates a table of environment names and their memory addresses
    (used internally by `environment_name` to return the names of user-defined environments).
